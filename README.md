# Night Pulse
I compiled this functioning app using ChatGPT 4 to monitor a users heart rate and send a tapic alert. This app is useful for those who experince night tremors. 

# App Explanation 
Use our app at night before you go to bed, and we’ll track your pulse to gently guide you out of a night terror using haptic feedback. Use our app with your tech, such as Apple or Android smartwatch.

When we have night terrors, they can be deeply distressing, and for some of us, they happen every night. As you go deeper into a night terror, your heart rate rises; when this happens, we use our advanced AI algorithm to gently send a nudge, which you won’t notice, to guide you away from the night terror, allowing you to enjoy a restful night sleep.
