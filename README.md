# Night Pulse
I compiled this functioning app using ChatGPT 4 to monitor a users heart rate and send a tapic alert. This app is useful for those who experince night tremors.
This is a basic application, which is a protype app to help nightmares and specially night terrors.

# Background
Use the app at night before you go to bed, and it’ll track your heart rate to gently guide you out of a night terror using haptic feedback. Use the app with your tech, such as Apple or Android smartwatch.

When we have night terrors, they can be deeply distressing, and for some of us, they happen every night. As you go deeper into a night terror, your heart rate rises; when this happens, we use our advanced AI algorithm to gently send a nudge, which you won’t notice, to guide you away from the night terror, allowing you to enjoy a restful night sleep. 

# Chat GPT Prompt

I would like you to use web pilot to access: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit. 

Write an Watch app that is called Night Pulse, which:

Show the users current heart rate on the app and updates if the heart rate changes.

Use Apple’s heart rate data to send a haptic vibration if the heart rate rises above the heart rate limit.
Include the logic for reading the heart rate and sending haptic feedback.


I will test this code on a Real Apple Watch, so please write code that is production ready.

Ensure you comment on your code to explain which files to put the code.

Tell me what code is required in the main swift file Night_PulseApp.swift and all other files necessary, be specific and combine any code that is in the same file.

Add the necessary HealthKit capabilities and permissions and write this code for SwiftUI View.
